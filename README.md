## Development Time: 3:30 PM - 7:17 PM

## Review and Reflection Time: 13 minutes

## Bug Fixing Time: 45 minutes

## Technologies Used: SwiftUI, Swift, Realm, Alamofire
Also, it seems that IR IPs are not supported by this API (a kind of bug that even ChatGPT couldnâ€™t fix for a few hours ðŸ˜¬ðŸ« ).

## New Update
The Main branch took almost 4 hours to develop. After an additional 2 hours and with the help of documentation and AI, I implemented a feature to check the userâ€™s connection. If the user is connected, the app will display the thumbnail, and the product images will be shown in the detail view. If the user is not connected, even if the image URLs were previously downloaded, the app will only show the Main branch app without images, as the images are loaded asynchronously from the internet. Version 2 is inside Branch V2.
