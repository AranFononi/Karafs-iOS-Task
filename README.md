The Main branch took almost 4 hours to develop. After an additional 2-3 hours and with the help of documentation and AI, I implemented a feature to check the userâ€™s connection. If the user is connected, the app will display the thumbnail, and the product images will be shown in the detail view. If the user is not connected, even if the image URLs were previously downloaded, the app will only show the Main branch app without images, as the images are loaded asynchronously from the internet. Version 2 is inside Branch V2.
